Explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical subject matter experts can be a challenge. Here's a suggested approach to explain Self-Harm Risk Bayesian Belief Networks in a way that's easy to understand:
Start with the Basics

    Introduce Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs): Explain that BBNs are a type of statistical model used to represent complex relationships between variables. Use an analogy like a decision tree or a flowchart to help them understand how BBNs work.
    Define Self-Harm Risk: Clearly explain what self-harm risk means in the context of your work. Emphasize that it's a sensitive topic and that your goal is to identify individuals who may be at risk to provide them with appropriate support.

Use a Relatable Example

    Illustrate with a Simple Example: Use a relatable scenario to demonstrate how a BBN works. For instance, imagine a BBN that predicts the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart attack based on factors like age, blood pressure, and family history.
    Map the Example to Self-Harm Risk: Once they understand the basic concept, explain how a similar BBN can be applied to predict self-harm risk. Discuss how various factors, such as mental health history, social support, and recent life events, can be used as inputs to the model.

Focus on the Benefits

    Emphasize the Importance of Early Identification: Highlight the importance of identifying individuals at risk of self-harm early on, so that interventions can be put in place to support them.
    Explain How BBNs Can Improve Accuracy: Discuss how BBNs can help improve the accuracy of self-harm risk assessments by taking into account multiple factors and their complex relationships.

Use Visual Aids and Storytelling

    Use Diagrams or Graphs: Visualize the BBN structure using diagrams or graphs to help non-technical experts understand the relationships between variables.
    Share Case Studies or Scenarios: Use real-life scenarios or case studies to illustrate how the BBN can be applied in practice. This can help make the concept more tangible and relatable.

Be Prepared to Address Concerns

    Anticipate Questions and Concerns: Be prepared to address potential concerns or questions, such as data privacy, model accuracy, or the potential for false positives/negatives.
    Offer Reassurance and Evidence: Provide reassurance that the model is designed with sensitivity and accuracy in mind, and offer evidence from research or pilot studies to support its effectiveness.

By following this approach, you should be able to effectively communicate the concept of Self-Harm Risk Bayesian Belief Networks to non-technical subject matter experts.
